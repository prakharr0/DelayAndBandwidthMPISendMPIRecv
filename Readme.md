Determine the delay and bandwidth of the connection between two nodes with the help of an MPI program, using *MPI_Send* and *MPI_Recv*.

**Delay**
-> Send a number back and forth between two processes, allocating one process per node. Calculate the time it takes for these data transfers.

**Bandwidth**
-> Output the bandwidth achieved in Gigabytes per second (GB/s) for a chunk size of 32MiB (Megabytes) to the console.
